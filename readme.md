# Arithmetic #

Inspired by The Little Schemer, by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

This is a cute little system of integer arithmetic that relies on only two functions (increment-by-one and decrement-by-one).

The Little Schemer demonstrates the incredible power of abstraction with this exercise -- with just an incrementer and decrementer, building a division function seemed basically impossible to me. However, by building intermediary levels of abstraction (other functions), building a division function is actually quite simple (and can be simulated in your head as you write it, which is the important part). Even as I started this exercise, I was baffled by division. But after writing addition, subtraction, and multiplication, division seemed downright obvious. Sussman (of SICP fame) and the authors of The Little Schemer aren't kidding: abstraction really is the key to building unimaginable things.

It's been a while since I read The Little Schemer, and I did this in a wild burst of excitement about 30 minutes after a few glasses of Scotch (I was trying to avoid having to program in Java). That means that any mistakes, ugliness, etc. are mine alone, and don't reflect on the book that inspired this.
